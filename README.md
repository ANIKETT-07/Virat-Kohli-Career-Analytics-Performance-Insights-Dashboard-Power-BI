# 5️⃣ Features / Highlights

## 🔹 Business Problem

Cricket performance data is often presented in raw statistical tables across multiple platforms.

However, it becomes difficult to quickly answer key analytical questions such as:

- How has performance evolved year by year?  
- Which format shows the highest consistency?  
- Where are the peak performance years?  
- How does strike rate vary across formats?  
- Against which teams does he perform best?  
- What is the distribution of centuries and half-centuries?  

Raw scorecards alone do not provide a clear performance narrative without structured visualization.

---

## 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive sports analytics tool that:

- Enables format-wise performance comparison  
- Tracks yearly progression and consistency  
- Highlights scoring milestones and achievements  
- Analyzes opponent-based performance trends  
- Supports sports performance storytelling through data
